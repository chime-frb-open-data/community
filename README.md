## Community Guidelines
We want to keep the CHIME/FRB community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need your help to keep it that way. To help with this we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

**Be nice:** Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!

**Encourage diversity and participation:** Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.

**Keep it legal:** Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information.

**Stay on topic:** Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.

**Don't send email to the maintainers:** There's no need to send email to the maintainers to ask them to investigate an issue or to take a look at a pull request. Instead of sending an email, GitHub mentions should be used to ping maintainers to review a pull request, a proposal or an issue.

## Reporting Issues
A great way to contribute to the FRB Community is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, and will thank you for it! When you make an issue, be sure to tag it with an appropriate label.

Check that our [issue database](https://github.com/chime-frb-open-data/community/issues?q=) doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on updates. If you have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

Also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster. When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a [gist](https://gist.github.com). Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can replace those parts with "REDACTED").
